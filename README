This records video from the Raspberry Pi camera, while also logging getting data 
from an accelerometer (LSM303DLHC) and GPS (Adafruit Ultimate GPS Module).  It 
can then overlay the collected data into a single video.

For hooking up everything to the Raspberry Pi, see pins.txt.

All data gets logged to the public/ directory.

Here's an overview of the important scripts:

* listener.sh - Waits for the button to be pressed, then starts the data logging 
  until the button is pressed again.
* record_accel.pl - Records accelerometer data
* record_gps.pl - Records GPS data
* record_video.pl - Records video
* make_overlay_video.pl - Creates an .mov which shows the accelerometer/GPS 
  data as an overlay
* combine_overlay.sh - Combines the main video with the overlay created by 
  make_overlay_video.pl
* vid_server.pl - Small web server that hosts the files in public/
